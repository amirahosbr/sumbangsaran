# Presentation Script: Expanding HUCA to AI Marketing Manager for OZ Website

> a character-designed brand ambassador that drives business-focused marketing to boost company's brand and revenue.

## Introduction: Hello and Our Story
Hello, team at OZ. Thank you for meeting. I am from our company. We already integrated HUCA into your Japanese website. HUCA is our headless chatbot—it helps answer questions from visitors using AI and your data.

Today, I want to tell a story. Imagine your website as a busy shop in Tokyo. Visitors come, ask questions, but many leave without buying. HUCA helps answer questions, but we can do more. We expand HUCA into a full AI Marketing Manager. This service grows your revenue—more sales, more visitors—not just save costs.

We use simple words—our **ubiquitous language**—like “grow sales” or “smart helper.” This makes ideas clear for business, not tech. Let’s story-tell through three parts: User Experience, Functionalities, and Fundamentals. This shows how HUCA becomes a revenue booster for OZ.

## Tier 1: User Experience (UX) - What Visitors See and Feel
First, the visitor on your OZ website. They want easy, fun shopping. HUCA already gives answers via chatbot. Now, as AI Marketing Manager, it makes the whole site smarter.

- **Smart Chat and Forms**: Visitors chat or fill forms. The AI suggests products, like “Try this new item based on your likes.” It feels personal, like a shop friend.
- **Easy for All (Accessibility)**: The chatbot works for everyone—in Japanese, with screen readers for disabled users, and clear designs. This keeps more people on your site.
- **Findable on Google (SEO)**: The AI adds search words, like “best OZ products in Japan.” Your site shows higher on Google, bringing more visitors who buy.

**Story Example**: A busy mom visits OZ. She asks the chatbot, “What’s good for kids?” It shows options, easy to read on her phone. Google sends her there because of smart SEO. She buys and comes back often. Revenue grows from happy, repeat customers.

## Tier 2: Functionalities - What Makes It Work for Revenue
Next, the smart actions behind the scenes. HUCA uses your data like files and database. Now, the AI does more to increase sales.

- **Automatic Marketing**: The AI sends emails with deals, posts on social media like LINE or Instagram, updates your site with new content, and runs ads on Google.
- **SEO Boost**: The AI checks your site, adds good words, and fixes links. This gets more free visitors from searches in Japan.
- **Accessibility Help**: The AI makes sure your site is easy for all users—adds captions to videos, clear colors. This builds trust and keeps visitors longer, leading to more buys.

**Story Example**: After the mom chats, the AI emails her a discount. It posts a fun ad on social media about kids’ products. It updates OZ site with a blog, “Top Kid Items 2025,” using Japanese search words. More people find OZ, shop, and revenue goes up—no extra work for your team.

## Tier 3: Fundamentals - The Smart System That Grows Your Business
Now, the core: our **agentic framework**. This is like the brain of the AI. We build it strong, from basics, to handle everything safely and smartly. It uses HUCA’s RAG and OpenAI, but adds more for marketing.

- **Tool Injection**: The AI picks tools like email or ads, based on what grows sales for OZ.
- **Safe and Fair (Safeguards)**: It checks for errors, like wrong ads, and follows rules—no bias, private data safe. Good for Japanese laws.
- **Human Handoff**: If a question is complex, like a big order, it passes to your team with details.
- **Scheduling and Logging**: The AI plans posts at best times, like evenings in Japan, and keeps records for you to check sales growth.
- **Asset Management**: It organizes your photos, texts, and data for quick campaigns.

**SEO and Accessibility in Fundamentals**:
- **SEO**: The framework makes all AI work easy for Google to see—better ranks, more visitors, higher revenue.
- **Accessibility**: It builds inclusive features, like Japanese voice support, to reach more customers.

**Story Example**: OZ has a new product launch. The AI schedules social posts, checks they’re accessible, and logs views. It runs Google ads with smart words. If a visitor needs help, it hands off to your staff. Sales jump because the site is top on search and easy for all.

## How HUCA Connects to This
HUCA is already on your site—great for answers. Now, expand to AI Marketing Manager: Use HUCA’s chatbot as the start, add marketing tools. It’s easy—no big changes. From cost-saving answers to revenue-growing actions, like auto-ads and posts.

**Your Benefits for OZ**:
- Grow revenue: More visitors from SEO, more sales from smart emails and posts.
- Easy setup: Just update the script tag we already have.
- Safe and local: Fits Japanese market, with privacy and accessibility.

## Conclusion: Let’s Grow Together
This AI Marketing Manager turns your OZ website into a revenue machine. It starts with HUCA, adds smart marketing. Yo-san’s vision makes it strong. What do you think? We can demo or customize for Japan. Thank you!
