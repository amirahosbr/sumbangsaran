# interaction patterns for AI agents

When discussing **interaction patterns for AI agents**, the focus is on how users engage with an agent and how the agent structures its responses and actions. Here are some of the most common and important interaction patterns used in designing AI agent experiences:

**1. Conversational Pattern:**  
Users interact with the agent using natural language or text, often in a back-and-forth, dialogue-based manner. The agent responds contextually, trying to understand intent, disambiguate when needed, and provide answers, recommendations, or actions.

**2. Command Pattern:**  
The user gives clear, direct instructions or commands, and the agent executes those without further clarification unless required. For example: “Set a timer for 10 minutes” or “Book a table for two at 7 PM.”

**3. Suggestion/Proactive Pattern:**  
The agent anticipates user needs, surfaces options, or offers recommendations before being explicitly asked. For instance, a travel agent might suggest rebooking options when a flight is delayed.

**4. Mixed-Initiative Pattern:**  
Both the agent and user can take the lead in the interaction. The user might start a conversation, but the agent can drive certain parts, ask clarifying questions, or suggest next steps.

**5. Guided Flow/Wizard Pattern:**  
The agent leads the user through a step-by-step, structured process (like onboarding or troubleshooting), often using forms or multiple choice questions to collect needed information.

**6. Notification/Alert Pattern:**  
The agent delivers timely messages, reminders, or alerts—sometimes requiring acknowledgement or action from the user.

**7. Multi-Modal Pattern:**  
The interaction spans across channels or input types: e.g., combining voice and screen, or chat plus clickable UI components.

**8. Learning/Feedback Loop Pattern:**  
The agent adapts over time by asking for user feedback (“Was this helpful?”) or learning from user corrections, and adjusts its future responses accordingly.

**Example Thought Experiment:**  
Imagine ordering food with an AI agent. A conversational pattern lets you type “I feel like pizza tonight.” The agent might use a suggestion pattern to recommend favorite pizzerias. If you just type “Order my usual,” that’s a command pattern. If your usual restaurant is closed, the agent might proactively suggest alternatives.

**Best Practice:**  
Most modern agents combine several patterns to optimize the user experience, such as using proactive suggestions within a conversational flow, or combining step-by-step forms (guided flow) with natural language understanding.
