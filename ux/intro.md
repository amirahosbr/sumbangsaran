**User Experience Impact:**

**Handles Multiple Tasks:** I can throw all my website needs at the AI, and it lines them up without overwhelming me.
**Smart Prioritization:** It suggests what’s most important (e.g., “Fix speed first for more visitors”) based on my site’s data.
**Flexible Control:** I can reorder, pause, or cancel tasks, so it fits my schedule.
**Risk:** If the queue is confusing or the AI prioritizes wrong, I might feel frustrated.

**Common Case Example:**

**User Says:** I’m Carlos, a travel blogger. I’m swamped and need to fix my site’s slow speed, post a new blog, and check broken links, but I don’t have time to do it all at once.
**AI Action:** I tell the AI: “Fix my site speed, suggest a post, and check links.” It creates a queue: “1. Speed up site (urgent for traffic), 2. Suggest post, 3. Check links.” It says: “Start with speed? It’ll boost visitors by 20%.” I can drag to reorder or pause tasks, and it updates me: “Speed fixed! Next: post suggestion.”
**How It Feels:** I love how it organizes my tasks and explains why speed comes first. I move the post suggestion up because I need content today, and it’s easy. I feel like I have a personal assistant keeping me on track.
**Payoff:** My site’s faster, I post on time, and links are fixed—all in a day, without stress.
