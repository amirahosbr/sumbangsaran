# What to do?

ai agent solution (web manager ai agent)

- how we can help them the user?

from website generator solution to ai agent solution

main task: propose 10 user experience if we provide ai agent product (ai agent web manager) -> pov from user

- think of what if we offer ai agent
- core functionality factors, composibility -> by combining functionalities we can realise user experience
- what kind of functionality we have in ai agent.. not just user experience (more than that)
- another worth to note, **Agent2Agent (A2A**). The A2A protocol will **allow AI agents to communicate with each other**
- research with ai agent that talks with other ai agent (our ai agents gonna communicate by themself with other ai agent)

A2A (Agent-to-Agent) and MCP (Model Context Protocol) are both open standard protocols for AI agents, but they serve different primary purposes.

- gonna maintain/design/image future accessibility by client side user experience
- accessibility is still our main priority
- focus on cutting edge idea as well

# How can you design AI agent experiences that feel safe, intuitive, and effective?

> Unlike static websites and apps, AI agents are dynamic — they can adapt, learn, and respond in real-time.
> 
> the goal of creating experiences that feel intelligent, responsive, and genuinely useful.

- When designing for AI agents, you’re not just focusing on user commands and static workflows; you **need to design for the fact that they can make decisions, adapt to changes, and act independently**.
- designing how a user interacts with the tool + how the AI agent observes its environment, processes information, decides which actions to take, and learns over time.

> What actions should it take on its own? How should it adapt when the situation changes? How transparent should it be about its decision-making process?

> not just designing how the user interacts with the system, but also how the AI agent interacts with the user, ensuring they feel informed and in control.

# 7 fundamental user experience (UX) Design principles?:

The 7 principles of design that all designers should follow are:

1. User-centricity
2. Consistency
3. Hierarchy
4. Context
5. User control
6. Accessibility
7. Usability

- **Clarity**: Ensure that the agent’s actions and decision-making are clear to the user. While autonomy is important, users should understand why the agent is making certain choices and how it impacts them.
- **Consistency**: Even though AI agents may evolve and learn over time, their core behaviours should remain predictable. Users should be able to anticipate the agent’s actions based on past interactions.
- **User control**: While AI agents act autonomously, users should still feel in control. Provide them with options to guide or influence the agent’s actions when necessary, ensuring that they don’t feel completely helpless.
- **Feedback**: Give users feedback on the agent’s decisions and actions. Whether through visual cues or notifications, users should know when the agent has acted or made a decision on their behalf.
- **Trust**: AI agents must build trust with users over time. Make sure that the agent’s actions align with user expectations and that it behaves in a way that feels reliable and safe.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that your AI agent is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This could mean designing for voice commands, providing alternative text for visual elements, or ensuring the agent’s actions can easily be interpreted by assistive technologies. You can learn more about [accessible design](https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/what-is-accessible-design/) in this guide.
- **Ethics and transparency**: Be mindful of ethical considerations. Ensure that the AI agent’s actions are transparent, and consider the implications of its decisions, especially when they affect the user’s privacy or safety.

## Choose the right interaction pattern

> decide what interaction pattern your AI agent will be built on
>
> An interaction pattern is the method through which users interact with the AI agent. The type of pattern you choose depends on what you’re building — and how much autonomy the agent should have versus the level of user control required.


> The keyword "interaction patterns for AI agents" is a goldmine because it moves beyond "what the agent does" to "how it feels to work with it."

## Challenges of designing for AI agents

As you design for your AI agent, consider:

- What happens if the AI agent doesn’t know something? How will it handle situations where it lacks information or doesn’t understand a command? Should it ask for clarification, offer alternatives, or simply admit its limitations? How can you design these responses to feel natural and reassuring for the user?
- How will you strike the balance between AI agent autonomy and user control? AI agents can act autonomously, but how much control should be left to the user? Is it clear when users can take control, override decisions, or return to a manual mode? How can you give users the right amount of flexibility without compromising the benefits of automation?
- How will you ensure that the AI agent makes ethical decisions? As the AI agent makes decisions on the user’s behalf, what ethical guidelines should it follow? How can you ensure fairness, privacy, and accuracy in decision-making? Will the user have visibility into how decisions are made, and will they feel confident that those decisions are unbiased and just?
- How will you manage user expectations regarding the AI agent’s capabilities? How can you make sure your users understand what the AI agent can and can’t do? Are you setting clear boundaries and expectations for its functionality? When the AI agent encounters limitations, how will you communicate this to users in a way that’s transparent and minimises frustration?
- How will you gain your end-users’ trust in the AI agent? How reliable is your AI agent, and how will you ensure it consistently meets user expectations? If the AI agent fails or makes a mistake, how can you course-correct and restore trust? What steps will you take to ensure that small mistakes don’t undermine the user’s overall confidence in the system?
- How do we leverage AI to make us more efficient? How can we incorporate AI into our existing products to provide a better user experience? How can we leverage AI to solve our users’ most pressing problems? How do we build a product founded entirely on AI? How do we design for a rapidly advancing technology and make it usable and user-friendly for humans? And how do we address the ethical concerns inherent in this technology?

As you design your AI agent, think critically about the challenges it might face — from handling uncertainty to ensuring ethical behaviour and managing user trust. This will enable you to anticipate potential pain points and have solutions built into the experience from day one.

# How to design for AI-first products

The key differentiator of AI-first products is that they:

- Learn and evolve through user interactions
- Anticipate needs instead of merely responding to explicit commands
- Personalize experiences at an unprecedented scale
- Augment human capabilities rather than simply automating tasks
- Generate novel content or solutions beyond pre-programmed responses

## The Future of AI-First Design
As generative AI continues to evolve, we're likely to see the emergence of even more sophisticated AI-first products with capabilities like:

- Multimodal interfaces that seamlessly blend text, voice, and visual interaction
- Agent-based systems that can perform complex tasks autonomously
- Collaborative intelligence where multiple specialized AI systems work together
- Adaptive interfaces that change based on user context and needs

## Challenges of designing for AI-first products

- **User trust:** How can we overcome user concerns around privacy, control, data protection, and ethics? How do we create AI-first products that feel safe and comfortable for the everyday user?
- **Ethical considerations:** We know that AI is inherently biased, so how can we detect and mitigate such biases early on? How do we actively avoid creating products that are harmful and discriminatory?
- **Scalability:** AI-first products are designed to learn and improve over time as they gather more and more data. As the product grows and evolves in complexity, how do we maintain optimal performance and usability?

# Core Functionalities of AI Agent Web Managers

Our proposed AI agent web manager integrates:

- **Web Automation**: Navigates sites, scrapes data, fills forms (e.g., Browser Use’s element extraction).
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Breaks tasks into subtasks, delegating to specialized agents (e.g., Manus’s 9+ LLMs).
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Retries failed actions, switches tools, or adjusts plans (e.g., Genspark’s tool selection).
- **Composability**: Combines LLMs (e.g., Claude, Gemini), APIs (e.g., CMS, bookings), and automation for hybrid workflows.
- **A2A/MCP Protocols**: Enables agents to communicate autonomously, sharing context for efficiency (e.g., Fellou → Genspark handoffs).
- **Transparency & Control**: Previews plans, allows edits, and provides feedback (e.g., Manus’s “Computer” interface).
- **Accessibility**: Supports voice inputs, multilingual interfaces, and assistive tech (e.g., Dia’s voice mode).
- **Ethics & Safety**: Uses local processing, encryption, and opt-in data sharing to build trust.
