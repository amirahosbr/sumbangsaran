### What to do tomorrow by yosan? (7 oct 2025)

1. meeting together in office and spread the part among us
2. scenario making or concept making to different people.. like input data, summary of the request.
3. use web tools to make the scenario and concept, character personality, storym, etc. (work flow part)
4. generating multiple image... and done simultaneously...
5. not creating or conclutize the design... imagine yosan is a client.. this time, yosan want us to think the solution...
6. "think the how we can solve the problem of generating images... (consistency, quality, multiple images, etc.)"
7. if want permanent right (commercial use, copyright, royalty, etc.) - svg, pay good money.. we have hundred thousands of images...
8. ai cms part... what is the use case?
9. secretagencyhuca into add all ai cms, public page, etc.
10. we gonna use huca to generate secret agent huca...
11. gonna use multiple ai like sora, openai, etc.

### What to do tomorrow by yosan? (8 oct 2025)

CLI task (AI Character Generator):

- gateway -> api gateway, before the application (no need to care for now) contain from cloudflare workers
- data -> no need to care for now
- cli -> extract data from data original.
- backend -> real application backend. no need to care for now
- cli and domain (need to care for now)
- cli -> src directory, have one index.ts file (it just the entry point) -> the configuration, defining the ...
- domain -> minietl. have modurable...
- minietl -> most important part.
- what kind of argument should we have? maybe character generator module in domain directory. maybe character generator expose generate function.
- what todo is: we defining the signature of the function. and type of argument... and discuss about the interface.
- vercel ai sdk maybe in vendor directory. openai in domain directory. (cancelled)
- ai sdk is image generation directory. (CharacterGeneration -> but not this case for HUCA project, maybe camelCase)

Example structure:

```
- src/domain
    - imageGenerator --> maybe this my task...
        - vendor
            - ai sdk image generation actual code
    - CharacterGeneratorCLI (main module)
        - entity
        - usecase
    - CharacterGeneratorWEB (main module)
```

#### Yosan's task

```
* Domain centric, modulable, composable, and parameter injectable design
    * Will reuse those domain components for our First-15-sec implementation
    * 3rd party library should be in vendor
    * Exec you code via unit test, but not for regressional tests nor coverage
    * Follow the architecture of coop-cs-net CLI
* Design function signature first
    * CLI arg, usecase arg
* Width/Height ratio should fit for Instagram
* Define good ubiquitous language
    * Do we (including user) call it "Character" or "Mascot"?
    * Describe by 1 Word as much as you can
    * e.g. Spread: In this project, "Spread" refers to the visual deployment or application examples of character images across various scenes.
* CLI should be what I can exec on my laptop with --output arg, no persistency required, nor no direct post to SNS is required for now
    * Just exporting images and text file (markdown or json/yaml) is fine, text file should contain character's name, story, design decision process...etc
* Interactive CLI console is not required, but I guess "Master Image" generation and "Spread Images" generation are better separated by CLI subcommands
    * Don't focus CLI dir, it's just parameter injection layer, write more in domain
* The main component (like "MiniETL" in coop-cs-net) should be owned by a person who can commit longer time, and sub components should be recent client-work assignees
* Not like phase 1, every components should be always ready to merge into main
* Don't try Agentic Loop now, just a workflow is fine, and don't rely on such libraries like LangGraph, Mastra, except 1st party libraries and Vercel's AI SDK
* Don't create huge PR like we did when phase 1, we go gradually, small CLI just invoke OpenAI image API is definitely our first step
* Back to the official manner of our development, GitHub Board, First Issue writing, Second PR writing, Self Review Process, I will check every decision records there
* Is this short enough?
```

# Wednesday, 8 oct 2025

- size of padding, position of the character-- full size design, mroe flexible -- less restriction, image style
- spread images -> same (image style) same style but the character is different.. (so tomorrow task)
- search: japanese card bikkuri card

library to build cli app
(gui kinda cli)

```
inquirer
chalk
ora
```

- no need gui.. but yaml.. use llm to generate detailed yaml. magic script we can create productive and all.. (specification of llm program, use yaml to execute the process)

- modurality in coop-csnet

using

- yosan want to inject something from outside the openai... like upfile, not crawlee

- basic default stream?? to use openai image generation..
- how many images ai check when generating image (example if we provide many image)

today task:

- make the process to have fix image style but less restriction on character design like position, frame, padding, etc. (japanese card bikkuri card)

- spread images -> same (image style) same style but the character is different.. (so tomorrow task)
- search: japanese card bikkuri card
- size of padding, position of the character-- full size design, mroe flexible -- less restriction, image style
- design something more flexible.. more flexible design.. more flexible image style.. more flexible character design..

vision flow:

0. business concept - business name, business type
1. character design - character name, character description, character props, etc.
2. have base reference character
3. have base image style (padding 2px, character at center, square 1:1, have plain background color, line weight and outline style) -> image style here is like a fixed style like a frame template where the character is placed inside.
4. character variation based on base reference character -> different facial expression, different pose, different background, different props, etc. -> based on user prompt. (in this case, user prompt is like a keyword, style, facial structure, etc.)
   keywords, styles, facial structure (eye shape, head proportions, smile type) etc..

character design variation:

1. Kawaii, character reference design based on concept
2. kawaii, character logo design (not full body, maybe just head, or like avatar icon)
3. kawaii,4-panel storytelling of the character design with based on concept of business type
4. photo realistic merchandise set for brand design kit (tumbler, mug, shirt, tote bag etc that appropriate with the business concept and busines nature.
5. photorealistic depict real settings (e.g., a shop, or an exhibition booth) where the original banner or packaging has been replaced with AI-generated image.
6. Realistic Character Design Mascot with Locals and Tourists, photorealistic

---

1. define business concept - business name, business type
2. define character design - secret agent name, keywords
3. define canvas layout - square 1:1 aspect ratio, character alignment centered with 2px padding, no border.
4. define master character reference - character fully visible, not cropped. Clean, minimal layout with soft neutral lighting and gentle shadow under the feet. Background uses a flat color different from the character's main tones. Sharp, clear focus, ultra HD.
5. based on master character reference, it spread into different variation character - different facial expression, different pose, different background, different props, etc.
6. spread image style -> different style (kawaii, photorealistic)

Great question! There are **two different "sizes"** in the AI image generation process:

## 1. **AI-SDK Size** (Technical Output Size)

This is the **actual pixel dimensions** of the generated image file:

```typescript
// In AISdk.ts - this controls the actual image file size
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-5"),
  prompt: imagePrompt.text,
  tools: {
    image_generation: openai.tools.imageGeneration({
      outputFormat: "webp",
      quality: "high",
      // No size specified here - uses default (usually 1024x1024)
    }),
  },
});
```

**Available AI-SDK sizes:**

- `1024x1024` (default)
- `1024x1792` (portrait)
- `1792x1024` (landscape)
- `1024x1024` (square)

## 2. **Prompt Size** (Stylistic Description)

This is **descriptive text** in the prompt that tells the AI about the visual style and composition:

```typescript
// In ImagePrompt.ts - this is just descriptive text
const promptText = `
Japanese collectible sticker (Bikkuriman-style), square 1:1 format (1024x1024),
chibi heroic mascot in dynamic pose...
`;
```

**Prompt sizes are descriptive:**

- `square 1:1 format (1024x1024)` - tells AI to make it square
- `each panel 300x300 pixels` - tells AI about panel sizes in storytelling
- `portrait orientation` - tells AI about composition

## Key Differences:

| Aspect       | AI-SDK Size                      | Prompt Size                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**  | Controls actual file dimensions  | Describes visual style/composition   |
| **Effect**   | Determines output file size      | Influences AI's artistic decisions   |
| **Values**   | `1024x1024`, `1024x1792`, etc.   | `square`, `portrait`, `panels`, etc. |
| **Location** | `imageGeneration()` tool options | Prompt text content                  |

## Example:

```typescript
// AI-SDK: Generate 1024x1024 actual image file
const result = await generateText({
  tools: {
    image_generation: openai.tools.imageGeneration({
      // This creates a 1024x1024 pixel image file
    }),
  },
});

// Prompt: Tell AI to make it look like a square sticker
const promptText = `
Japanese collectible sticker (Bikkuriman-style), square 1:1 format (1024x1024),
chibi heroic mascot in dynamic pose...
`;
```

## In Your Current Code:

Looking at your `ImagePrompt.ts`:

```typescript
size: z.enum(['1024x1024']), // This is just descriptive text
```

This `size` field is **descriptive only** - it tells the AI about the style, but the actual image dimensions are controlled by the AI-SDK tool options.

## Recommendation:

You could either:

1. **Keep it descriptive** (current approach) - `size: '1024x1024'` in prompt
2. **Make it functional** - Use the size to control actual AI-SDK output:

```typescript
// Option 2: Use ImagePrompt size to control actual output
const imagePrompt = CharacterDesigner.buildPrompt(concept, variation);
const result = await generateText({
  tools: {
    image_generation: openai.tools.imageGeneration({
      outputFormat: "webp",
      quality: "high",
      size: imagePrompt.size, // Use the size from ImagePrompt
    }),
  },
});
```

The current approach is fine - the prompt size is descriptive and helps the AI understand the intended visual style!

# Looking at your complete image-generation system, here's the comprehensive analysis:

## **🔄 DDD Flow:**

```
Entity → Value Objects → Use Case → Vendor → OpenAI API
  ↓           ↓            ↓         ↓         ↓
BusinessConcept → CanvasRules → CharacterDesigner → AISdk → gpt-5
              → ImagePrompt → GenerateCharacterImages
              → ColorPalette
```

## **📁 File Analysis by Layer:**

### **✅ ENTITY Layer (Domain Core):**

- **`BusinessConcept.ts`** - ✅ **USED** - Business data (Kek Lapis Keeper pastry shop)

### **✅ VALUE OBJECTS Layer:**

- **`CanvasRules.ts`** - ✅ **USED** - Canvas layout rules (aspect, margin, alignment, border)
- **`ImagePrompt.ts`** - ✅ **USED** - Prompt validation structure
- **`ColorPalette.ts`** - ✅ **USED** - Color scheme validation

### **✅ USE CASE Layer (Business Logic):**

- **`CharacterDesigner.ts`** - ✅ **USED** - Core prompt generation (4 variations)
- **`GenerateCharacterImages.ts`** - ✅ **USED** - Orchestrates 3-image workflow

### **✅ VENDOR Layer (Infrastructure):**

- **`AISdk.ts`** - ✅ **USED** - OpenAI API integration (functional approach)

### **📂 Generated Assets:**

- **`images/base-reference.png`** - ✅ Generated base image

## **🎯 How Image Generation Works:**

### **1. Business Setup (Entity):**

```typescript
BusinessConcept.createCharacterDesign() → {
  businessName: 'Kek Lapis Keeper',
  businessType: 'Pastry Shop',
  characterDescription: 'cute layered cake mascot with traditional heritage charm',
  keywords: ['layered cake', 'traditional', 'heritage', 'sweet treats'],
  secretAgentName: 'Agent Sweet',
  colorPalette: { primary: 'yellow', secondary: 'green', accent: 'brown' }
}
```

### **2. Canvas Rules Applied (VO):**

```typescript
CanvasRules.defaultCanvas → {
  aspect: '1:1',           // ✅ Square aspect ratio
  marginPx: 2,             // ✅ 2px padding
  alignment: 'center',     // ✅ Character alignment
  border: false            // ✅ No border
}
```

### **3. Prompt Generation (Use Case):**

**CharacterDesigner** creates 4 variations:

- **BASE**: Full-body reference with canvas constraints
- **LOGO**: Head-only with business name
- **STORYTELLING**: 4-panel comic strip
- **MASCOT**: Photorealistic with locals/tourists

### **4. Image Generation (Vendor):**

**AISdk** calls OpenAI gpt-5 with generated prompts and saves images

## **✅ Canvas Rules Setup - PERFECT:**

Your `CanvasRules` exactly matches requirements:

| Component     | Your Value | Requirement         | Status |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| **aspect**    | `'1:1'`    | Square aspect ratio | ✅     |
| **marginPx**  | `2`        | 2px padding         | ✅     |
| **alignment** | `'center'` | Character alignment | ✅     |
| **border**    | `false`    | Border setting      | ✅     |

## **🎨 Base Character Reference:**

Your system generates:

- ✅ **Full-body character** (cute layered cake mascot)
- ✅ **Canvas constraints** (1:1, 2px padding, centered)
- ✅ **Neutral kawaii style** (Japanese collectible sticker style)
- ✅ **Flat background** (different from character tones)
- ✅ **First generated asset** (saved to `images/base-reference.png`)

## **🚀 How to Run in Terminal:**

### **Option 1: Run AISdk Directly**

```bash
npx tsx image-generation/vendor/AISdk.ts
```

### **Option 2: Run Full Workflow (Create runner)**

```typescript
// Create: src/domain/image-generation/run.ts
import { BusinessConcept } from "./entity/BusinessConcept";
import { CanvasRules } from "./vo/CanvasRules";
import { GenerateCharacterImages } from "./usecase/GenerateCharacterImages";
import { openAIImageGenerator } from "./vendor/AISdk";

async function run() {
  const businessConcept = BusinessConcept.createCharacterDesign();
  const canvas = CanvasRules.defaultCanvas;

  const result = await GenerateCharacterImages.execute(
    businessConcept,
    canvas,
    openAIImageGenerator
  );

  console.log("🎉 Generated 3 images!");
}

run().catch(console.error);
```

Then: `npx tsx image-generation/run.ts`

## **📊 Summary:**

- ✅ **All files are USED** - No unused code
- ✅ **Perfect DDD structure** - Clean layer separation
- ✅ **Canvas rules implemented** - Exactly as specified
- ✅ **Base character reference** - Full-body with constraints
- ✅ **Ready to run** - AISdk has direct runner function

**Your image generation system is complete and properly architected!** 🎉

# Character Design Options

Here are some different character design options you can try! Just update the `createCharacterDesign()` function in `BusinessConcept.ts`:

## **Option 1: Otter Coffee Shop**

```typescript
export const createCharacterDesign = (): t => {
  return create({
    businessName: "Otter Bean Café",
    businessType: "Coffee Shop",
    characterDescription:
      "adorable otter barista wearing a tiny apron and holding a coffee cup",
    keywords: [
      "otter",
      "coffee beans",
      "barista apron",
      "whiskers",
      "cute paws",
    ],
    secretAgentName: "Agent Brew",
    colorPalette: {
      primary: "brown",
      secondary: "cream",
      accent: "orange",
    },
  });
};
```

## **Option 2: Penguin Ice Cream Shop**

```typescript
export const createCharacterDesign = (): t => {
  return create({
    businessName: "Penguin Scoops",
    businessType: "Ice Cream Parlor",
    characterDescription:
      "cheerful penguin chef with a bow tie and ice cream scoop",
    keywords: ["penguin", "bow tie", "ice cream scoop", "chef hat", "flippers"],
    secretAgentName: "Agent Freeze",
    colorPalette: {
      primary: "blue",
      secondary: "white",
      accent: "pink",
    },
  });
};
```

## **Option 3: Fox Bakery**

```typescript
export const createCharacterDesign = (): t => {
  return create({
    businessName: "Foxy Pastries",
    businessType: "Bakery",
    characterDescription:
      "clever fox baker with flour-dusted paws and a chef hat",
    keywords: ["fox", "chef hat", "flour dusted paws", "bushy tail", "baker"],
    secretAgentName: "Agent Dough",
    colorPalette: {
      primary: "orange",
      secondary: "white",
      accent: "red",
    },
  });
};
```

## **Option 4: Panda Tea House**

```typescript
export const createCharacterDesign = (): t => {
  return create({
    businessName: "Zen Panda Tea",
    businessType: "Tea House",
    characterDescription:
      "peaceful panda monk holding a steaming tea cup with zen expression",
    keywords: ["panda", "tea cup", "zen monk", "bamboo", "meditation pose"],
    secretAgentName: "Agent Zen",
    colorPalette: {
      primary: "black",
      secondary: "white",
      accent: "green",
    },
  });
};
```

## **Option 5: Rabbit Vegetable Market**

```typescript
export const createCharacterDesign = (): t => {
  return create({
    businessName: "Bunny Fresh Market",
    businessType: "Vegetable Stand",
    characterDescription:
      "energetic rabbit farmer with overalls and a carrot in hand",
    keywords: ["rabbit", "overalls", "carrot", "farmer hat", "long ears"],
    secretAgentName: "Agent Carrot",
    colorPalette: {
      primary: "green",
      secondary: "orange",
      accent: "brown",
    },
  });
};
```

## **How to Apply:**

Just replace the `createCharacterDesign()` function in your `BusinessConcept.ts` with any of these options, then run:

```bash
npx tsx image-generation/vendor/AISdk.ts
```
