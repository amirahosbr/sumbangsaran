# Presentation Script: HUCA as OZ’s AI Brand Ambassador for Creative Services

## Introduction: The HUCA Story
Hello, OZ team. Thank you for joining. I’m from our company. Let’s tell a story about your marketing manager finding HUCA.

One day, OZ’s marketing manager, a creative agency offering digital and design services, spots the HUCA app. HUCA generates a unique AI character as a brand ambassador. OZ tries it—inputs company info, like creative projects and values, and asks for an animal-based character. HUCA creates a cute capybara named CapyOZ! This friendly ambassador boosts OZ’s brand and attracts more clients through smart marketing.

We use simple words, like “grow clients” or “friendly face,” for business clarity. CapyOZ makes your campaigns and website shine. Let’s explain in three parts: User Experience, Functionalities, and Fundamentals.
