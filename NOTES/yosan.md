# Feedback (Initial direction)

1. Ubiquitous language -> Ubiquitous Language is a core Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concept, a shared vocabulary developed by technical and business stakeholders to ensure consistent and precise communication across all project artifacts, from discussions and documentation to the code itself.

- more like business mindset than technical mindset. business planner not software developer. when do this.
- once again consider -> client digital, including our visitor of our website.
- include client website digital experience that can most leverage approach. most effective user experience script tag to embed, form inquiry.
- implement script tag to embed.

first requirements from yosan (for us extract fundamental):

- first tier: user experience (ux)
- second tier: functionality (autonomous that makes the ux effective) (knowledge base: want more than that.. like rdbms)

  - os layer: can manage memory allocation, maybe networking.
  - before think about ai agent tools like langchain, but need to think more before.. like proper structure.. like long term memory.
  - fundamental layer before the tools need to do.. our presentation is more like feature layer. so need OS layer.
  - user experience scenario.. for first 15-seconds..

- choose the right term - ubiquitous language.
- also story telling.
- user experience of digital website of a client.
- embedded something to client website.
- fundamental layer like os level or os layer ??

##### important takes (want to learn about revenue planning too, next task):

- most fun vivid fresh creative idea as a software engineer. (provided idea to client but to implement it???)
- join planning part.. people looks at software eng as how but not what.
- want to join planning and upstream part important for us too (management??).
- no need to more detailed, simulation.
- product rate growth: target
- do the revenue planning.. and have template.. but different plan. yosan will tell the spec.. and i have to tell the story if after year sekian2.. what happen from monetary aspect.
- "now they are still 1000$.. but next year.. they want to grow to 10000$.. and we have to tell the story.. how we can grow to 10000$.. and what is the plan."
- ARR: annual recurring revenue?????

##### Quick meeting with yosan

- ai agent web manager: we gonna create some product for their marketing success.
- eg; customer acquisition channel (sns, google ads..) if huca is a product which help them to get more customer. if we use web marketing tool, then we need to do web marketing.
- need to believe in our product.
- are we really create what our product
- focus on producing benefit part. 2 strategy. first, decrease cost. first, increase revenue.
- cost-cutting proposal not effective for them for small (100-150 employees) company.. even with yosan system. but, for big company.. it can be effective.
- eg; layoff one of cost cutting strategy. (software system investment)
- yosan focus more on increase profit.
- provide convenient tools for their web manager time...
  **- our solution something that can help them to increase revenue. not cost-cutting.**
- and we gonna use huca, to spread huca.
- our idea maybe shrink.
- lets say huca provide convenient thing like but content matter. we can help them to do content marketing.
- brand strategy.. make their brand more popular?
  **- example me: it took me 4-5 years to get this amount of followers. the way i do is mostly either post everyday.. or post something interesting, something current issues, to debate, to discuss...**
- source: sento kun
- more branding upstream. can create marketing software strategy. but how? eg; character approach. how to improve our marketing web service to people?

- dig deeper later for the 3 user scenarios.
- hypothesis/summary or biased idea of why their sales decrease (like for expert in marketing).
- earned media (free exposure a brand receives from third parties, such as customers or the press, without direct payment, encompassing content like articles, reviews, and social shares.) -> maybe having ai cms is helpful. like daily.dev??
- scenario 3: enhance experience like color scheme, font, logo, etc. ideas. display example like this.. when raj suggest: branding guidleine/branding design (https://www.flux-academy.com/blog/what-is-brand-design)
- What is the purpose of a moodboard? -> One of the major purposes of a mood board is to help visualise ideas and bring them to life in more than just words.
- focus on localized first, then global. (chart for KB). also maybe can combine international and localization.. maybe ai can do that to filter out the content.
- assets store. need assets store.
  - functionalities where ai can generate assets. files that we can manage.. asset management.
- task management: every execution in ai model, better acute... not only one user use ai agent, can multiple users use ai agent. occasional.. how to manage that?
- like audit log...
- data protection and privacy.
- basically, autonomous.. need to have safeguard.. not adhoc functionalities.
- but fundamental functionalities...
-

Revenue planning:

- eg; how to get 3m yen in 3rd quarter
- kpi: monthly, quarterly, yearly.
- eg; 10 clients in first month..
- the way we acquire customers as well.

# Weekly Meeting with yosan (friday, 10 oct 2025)

- crawling images for some usecase.
- https://www.convertapi.com/png-to-svg

- yosan:

  - we are creating mcp server.
  - want to have user experience on chatbot. ai agent gonna take action. (its like chatgpt latest agent)
  - so claude will choose which mcp tools to choose.
  - so, we are building mcp server.
  - so, basically we are building ai agent thru cli claude code that connect with our own mcp server (mcp tools created by us combine to a single mcp server).

- huca website:

  - fundamental functionality (knowledge base, domain implementation by artifacts, knowledge files etc. (artifacts will be created by ai agent like image file, asset file etc.))
  - asset file is user uploaded file. like image file, pdf file, etc.
  - cron schedule. to create contet etc.
  - each character have different personality. (embody of the kehai idea) --> its like character design + like in chatgpt customization tone.
  - dont want to have input form -> so directly from ai agent??
  - domain entity: small abstract component. (like projection metaphore... we go differently)
  - not focus on fe or be... focus on domain entity.
  - creating until december on webservice with front end and database...

- that have own character maybe can join secret agency huca... (maybe was thinking like create a community of character?? -> one day to have own public community, meetups of among agent...(sounds fishy??? mlm?))
