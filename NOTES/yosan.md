# Feedback (Initial direction)

1. Ubiquitous language -> Ubiquitous Language is a core Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concept, a shared vocabulary developed by technical and business stakeholders to ensure consistent and precise communication across all project artifacts, from discussions and documentation to the code itself.

- more like business mindset than technical mindset. business planner not software developer. when do this.
- once again consider -> client digital, including our visitor of our website.
- include client website digital experience that can most leverage approach. most effective user experience script tag to embed, form inquiry.
- implement script tag to embed.

first requirements from yosan (for us extract fundamental):
- first tier: user experience (ux)
- second tier: functionality (autonomous that makes the ux effective) (knowledge base: want more than that.. like rdbms)
    - os layer: can manage memory allocation, maybe networking.
    - before think about ai agent tools like langchain, but need to think more before.. like proper structure.. like long term memory.
    - fundamental layer before the tools need to do.. our presentation is more like feature layer. so need OS layer.
    - user experience scenario.. for first 15-seconds..

- choose the right term - ubiquitous language.
- also story telling.
- user experience of digital website of a client.
- embedded something to client website.
- fundamental layer like os level or os layer ??

##### important takes (want to learn about revenue planning too, next task):

- most fun vivid fresh creative idea as a software engineer. (provided idea to client but to implement it???)
- join planning part.. people looks at software eng as how but not what.
- want to join planning and upstream part important for us too (management??).
- no need to more detailed, simulation.
- product rate growth: target
- do the revenue planning.. and have template.. but different plan. yosan will tell the spec.. and i have to tell the story if after year sekian2.. what happen from monetary aspect.
- "now they are still 1000$.. but next year.. they want to grow to 10000$.. and we have to tell the story.. how we can grow to 10000$.. and what is the plan."
- ARR: annual recurring revenue?????

##### Quick meeting with yosan

- ai agent web manager: we gonna create some product for their marketing success.
- eg; customer acquisition channel (sns, google ads..) if huca is a product which help them to get more customer. if we use web marketing tool, then we need to do web marketing.
- need to believe in our product.
- are we really create what our product 
- focus on producing benefit part. 2 strategy. first, decrease cost. first, increase revenue.
- cost-cutting proposal not effective for them for small (100-150 employees) company.. even with yosan system. but, for big company.. it can be effective.
- eg; layoff one of cost cutting strategy. (software system investment)
- yosan focus more on increase profit.
- provide convenient tools for their web manager time...
**- our solution something that can help them to increase revenue. not cost-cutting.**
- and we gonna use huca, to spread huca.
- our idea maybe shrink.
- lets say huca provide convenient thing like but content matter. we can help them to do content marketing. 
- brand strategy.. make their brand more popular? 
**- example me: it took me 4-5 years to get this amount of followers. the way i do is mostly either post everyday.. or post something interesting, something current issues, to debate, to discuss...**

- more branding upstream. can create marketing software strategy. but how? eg; character approach. how to improve our marketing web service to people?
