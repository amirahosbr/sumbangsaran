# What to do?

ai agent solution (web manager ai agent)

- how we can help them the user?

from website generator solution to ai agent solution

main task: propose 10 user experience if we provide ai agent product (ai agent web manager) -> pov from user

- think of what if we offer ai agent
- core functionality factors, composibility -> by combining functionalities we can realise user experience
- what kind of functionality we have in ai agent.. not just user experience (more than that)
- another worth to note, **Agent2Agent (A2A**). The A2A protocol will **allow AI agents to communicate with each other**
- research with ai agent that talks with other ai agent (our ai agents gonna communicate by themself with other ai agent)

A2A (Agent-to-Agent) and MCP (Model Context Protocol) are both open standard protocols for AI agents, but they serve different primary purposes.

- gonna maintain/design/image future accessibility by client side user experience
- accessibility is still our main priority
- focus on cutting edge idea as well
